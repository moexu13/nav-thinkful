## General info
This was an early project for Thinkful using Flexbox to create a responsive navigation section. It was automatically graded so I took a few liberties with the design since no one would see it.

## Technologies
* HTML5
* CSS3 including Flexbox

## Setup
This is a simple HTML page - no setup is required.

## Status
Project is complete - it has been turned in and graded.
